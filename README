SIMPLE CLOUDHASKELL STORAGE SERVICE
===================================

This code is distributed under the terms of the GPL, so use it, change it, etc but
please acknowledge its origin.

Installation
============

(1) Download CloudHaskell from git://github.com/jepst/CloudHaskell.git
(2) Install it with 'cabal install' in its top level directory
(3) Download the storage server code from git://github.com/Julianporter/Distributed-Haskell.git 
    onto two machines
(4) Modify the two files 'config_master' and 'config_storage' to refer to your two machines' 
    names.  I have used the names 'joker.local' for the server and 'batman.local' for the client
(4) On each machine install the application with 'cabal install' in its top level directory

Testing
=======

(1) On the server machine invoke 'MR -s'
(2) On the client machine invoke 'MR -c' (if you do this first, you will get an exception
    complaining that no server is running)

You will see debugging output on both machines.  The client sends two slugs, each of five items
of type (Int,String), to the server, does an exchange and reads them back.

Generally
=========

The server and client API are in Storage.hs, and are fully documented.  The client programme
in Main.hs gives a good idea of simple CloudHaskell.
